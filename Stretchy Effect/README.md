Stretchy Effect is a cool effect which can be used in lieu of tableView headerView. When the tableView is pulled down the headerView gets dragged and zoomed in. I have used the following libraries to complete this demo app


  - Alamofire to make HTTP requets
  - AlamofireImage to download images
  - SwiftyJSON to handle JSON data

I used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.it/) REST API to get neat images. Luckily for this API, the request calls should be made via HTTPS, which complied with Apple's App Transport Security.

Parrot is an image recognition app. It uses IBM Watson Image Recognition API to classify images. I'll soon add a live camera feature which can spontaneously recognize the objects

I have used the following libraries while creating this application:

  - Alamofire: to make HTTP requests and to download images
  - VisualRecognitionV3: To classify images

I used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.it/) to generate images randomly

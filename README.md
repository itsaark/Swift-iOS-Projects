This repo contains my pet projects that I have built using Swift programming language. Most of them are broadly related to the following areas: 


  - Algorithms in Swift
  - AI and Machine Learning projects using Swift
  - Animations, Transitions and other cool effects in iOS
  




> Most of these projects are inspired by various online tutorials. Initially, most of the projects would be a direct emulation(with little tweaks and customization) of the tutorials I learn from. As I get better at this, I would be creating interesting projects on my own. Watch out!

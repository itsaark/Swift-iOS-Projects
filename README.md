This repo contains my pet projects that I'll constantly be building using Swift programming language. Most of them are broadly related to the following areas:


    - Algorithms using Swift
    - AI and Machine Learning projects using Swift
    - Animations, Transitions and other cool effects in iOS

 >  Initially, most of these projects would be a direct emulation(with little tweaks and customization) of the online tutorials. As I get better at this, I would be creating exciting projects on my own. Watch out!
